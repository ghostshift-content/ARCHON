**Autonomous AI web-application penetration tester — white-box + black-box in one engagement.**

ARCHON is an autonomous AI penetration tester for web applications. Instead of one prompt told to
"find every bug," it drives a durable *squad* of LLM agents — a lead that fingerprints the stack and
plans the attack, per-class specialists (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, access control, API, …) that go deep in
parallel, and independent verifiers that re-probe every finding and reject whatever they can't
reproduce. Confirmed, de-duplicated findings — each fully written up with CWE, CVSS, reproduction,
impact, and remediation — land **live on your Findings board** as the scan runs. Point it at a **URL**
for a black-box assessment, or a **URL + source code** for a combined white-box + black-box engagement
whose source and runtime views correlate into one de-duplicated set.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostshift-content/ARCHON.git archon && cd archon
bash setup.sh          # Node check → npm install → seed var/intel → preflight (npm run doctor)

npm start              # 1) the agent daemon (event-bus)
npm run dashboard      # 2) separate shell → portal at http://localhost:4000
```

Then open **http://localhost:4000 → New dispatch**.

**The one real prerequisite** is a **Claude subscription + the `claude` CLI, logged in** — ARCHON runs
every agent on your subscription over OAuth, *not* a metered API key (install
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and run `claude` once). Beyond that you need **Node ≥ 18** and
**git** (macOS / Linux, or Windows via WSL). A fresh clone needs **no config** — roots resolve to the repo
directory automatically. Optional black-box recon tools (`nmap`, `naabu`, …) are all fail-soft, so you can
skip them; a static code-review run needs only Node + `claude`.

`bash setup.sh` ends by running **`npm run doctor`** — a preflight that prints exactly what's present vs
missing (Node, the `claude` login, optional tools). Run **`npm run doctor`** any time a dispatch fails.

## Why ARCHON

A pentest is mostly orchestration: map the surface, fingerprint the stack, decide what to attack, try it,
**prove it's real**, write it up. ARCHON runs that as a durable multi-agent system instead of a single
prompt:

- **Specialists, not a monolith.** A lead agent plans a stack-specific attack walk; per-class specialists
  (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, IDOR, …) each go deep on their own domain — far deeper than one prompt told to "find
  every bug."
- **Evidence over claims.** Every finding is re-probed by an independent **AUDITOR**; anything without
  replayable evidence is demoted, not reported. A multi-judge consensus gates High/Critical.
- **You stay in control.** Findings validate **live onto your board**; when testing finishes the run
  completes and you generate the report on demand. Nothing is auto-published.
- **One report, both views.** White-box (source) and black-box (live) findings are correlated and
  de-duplicated — the same bug shows up as `file:line` *and* an HTTP repro.
- **Your subscription, no API key.** Agents run the `claude` CLI over your Claude subscription (OAuth);
  there is no metered `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

---

## How ARCHON works

You dispatch a target. Behind the portal, a durable daemon (**NEXUS**, `event-bus.js`) spins up a *squad*
— a lead, ~15 vulnerability specialists, and a team of validators — and drives them through a phased
pentest while findings land on your board live.

- **The lead plans.** ATLAS (live pentest) / CURATOR (source review) fingerprints the exact stack —
  product, framework, WAF vendor, CVE leads — and ranks a **stack-specific attack plan** (AEM → dispatcher
  bypass; WordPress → WP CVEs), walking the OWASP WSTG A–Z map so nothing is skipped.
- **Specialists attack, in parallel.** The roster runs in throttled waves; each specialist owns one domain
  and goes deep — generate stack-specific payloads, fire → observe → mutate → re-fire, adapt to the WAF.
  A **focused scan** ("test XSS + access-control only") runs *just* those specialists; a full scan runs the
  whole A–Z.
- **A triager squad validates live.** The moment a specialist reports a finding, a pool of **TRIAGER**
  agents — it scales up as the backlog grows — validates it, drops duplicates, merges related issues,
  scores CVSS 3.1, and writes it to report quality *while the scan is still running*. Clean, de-duplicated
  findings appear on your board one at a time; raw agent chatter never does.
- **Independent verification gates everything.** AUDITOR re-probes each finding with fresh requests and
  refuses anything it can't reproduce (the **evidence contract**); a multi-judge consensus gates
  High/Critical. Nothing reaches the board on a specialist's word alone.
- **You stay in control.** When testing finishes the run completes — your board holds the validated set.
  Review at your pace, then generate the report on demand. **SCRIBE** writes one professional dossier;
  nothing auto-publishes.

Every phase is **fail-soft** — any single agent can error, log, and the run keeps going. Under the hood
the portal writes *only* to the daemon's inbox (`var/intel/inbox/`, the filesystem is the IPC boundary),
the daemon is the single writer of core state, and each agent runs the `claude` CLI (OAuth, no API key).

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎯 **Black-box** | Recon → stack fingerprint → ranked attack plan → parallel specialist waves (fire → observe → mutate → re-fire), WAF-adaptive. |
| 🔬 **White-box** | Reads the actual code: inventories → app blueprint → feature mapping → per-class assessment → AUDITOR reverse-check. Candidates are **reviewed in context** to confirm the data flow reaches a sink, then reported at file and line with the vulnerable code block as proof. Review classes are **auto-selected from the discovered surface** (all 23 catalog classes available). |
| 🔗 **Merged engagement** | Run both; findings aggregate and one report **de-duplicates** the same vuln seen from source and over the wire. |
| 🧪 **Independent verification** | AUDITOR re-probes findings; the **evidence contract** demotes anything without replayable proof; chain-verifier replays multi-step exploits via curl. |
| 🏷️ **Honest confirmation status** | Each finding is tagged `RUNTIME_CONFIRMED` (proven live) vs `SOURCE_CONFIRMED` (proven in code only) vs `NEEDS_LIVE_VALIDATION` / `DISPROVEN` — a source read is never dressed up as a live proof. |
| 🧑‍⚖️ **Live triage + judge consensus** | A scaling **triager squad** writes report-quality findings during the scan; a multi-judge consensus gates High/Critical. |
| 🎛️ **Focused scans** | Pick specific classes ("XSS + access-control only") and the lead runs *only* those specialists — or run the full A→Z. |
| ⏸️ **On-demand reporting** | Review — confirm / reject / set CVSS (built-in 3.1 calculator) / annotate — then generate the report when ready. Nothing auto-publishes. |
| 🔁 **Iterations** | Add focused passes to an engagement ("now test access control") without disturbing prior results. |
| 🛡️ **Safety perimeter** | Fail-closed scope gate; impact-proving exploits fire only behind a 3-gate opt-in (off by default). |
| 🖥️ **Local portal** | Zero-build single-page dashboard (binds `127.0.0.1`) for dispatch, live progress, triage, and reports. |
| 📚 **Scored A–Z coverage** | Per-area coverage **scores** ("Authentication: 90%") across OWASP WSTG, reporting transport/config hygiene (TLS, HSTS, headers, cookie flags) alongside exploitable bugs — untested areas stated honestly. |

## The squads

Agents are **AI personas** the daemon spawns — each runs the `claude` CLI over your subscription and owns
one role (they use operator call-signs). **NEXUS** is the daemon itself (`event-bus.js`), not a persona.

### `pentest` — black-box (lead: **ATLAS**)

| Agent | Domain | | Agent | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ATLAS** | Lead / attack planner | | **GATEWAY** | API security (incl. JWT) |
| SCOUT | Recon / surface mapping | | SENTRY | Config & transport hygiene / compliance |
| RANGER | DAST + OS command injection | | KEYRING | Session management / auth |
| TRACER | Crawling / endpoint discovery | | LEDGER | Business logic |
| VIPER | XSS | | FORGE | Supply-chain / deserialization |
| DRILL | SQL injection | | DECOY | CSRF |
| RELAY | SSRF | | SPECTRE | XXE |
| VAULT | LFI / path traversal | | WARDEN | IDOR / access control / logic |

### `code-review` — white-box (lead: **CURATOR**)

`MARSHAL` (access control) · `CIPHER` (injection/XSS) · `QUILL` · `BEACON` · `BREAKER` · `SIPHON`
— feature mappers and per-class specialists · `PROBER` — runtime validator (live-checks source findings
against a deploy URL).

### Universal agents (`_universal/agents/`)

**AUDITOR** (independent verifier) · **ARBITER** (confidence judge / publication gate) · **SCRIBE**
(final reporter) · **COMMAND** (coordination) · **TRIAGER** (validate + dedup + merge, owns the Findings
board) · **WRITER** (per-finding writeup).

---

## Engagement modes

The three modes differ only in the input and whether payloads are fired — they all flow through the same
[lead → specialists → triager → verify → report](#how-archon-works) pipeline.

| Mode | Input | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Black-box** | URL | Live pentest — specialists fire payloads against the running target. |
| **Static / white-box** | source dir | Reads the code, **no payloads fired**: pattern recognition finds candidates, each is confirmed in context, and findings are reported at file and line with the vulnerable code block as proof (no HTTP request needed). |
| **White-box (combined)** | URL + source dir | The code review runs **first**; its findings then aim a **source-guided** live pentest that verifies each candidate against the running target (PROBER also runtime-validates during the review). `cross-view-dedup` merges the source and runtime views into one report. |

An **engagement** holds N independent iterations (the white-box + black-box pair, plus any focused re-runs
you add). Findings aggregate across iterations and one report is generated over all of them. Every finding
states its confirmation status honestly: `RUNTIME_CONFIRMED` when proven live, `SOURCE_CONFIRMED` when
proven in code only — a source read is never presented as a live exploit.

## Benchmark

OWASP Juice Shop, scored on the vulnerability classes it is known to contain — the same ground truth and
scorer grade **both** run types against the same app. Full reports with charts and the per-class breakdown:
[`benchmark/RESULTS-blackbox.md`](./benchmark/RESULTS-blackbox.md) ·
[`benchmark/RESULTS-codereview.md`](./benchmark/RESULTS-codereview.md).

| Run type | Class coverage | Confirmed findings |
|---|---|---|
| **Black box** (live pentest) | **12 of 15 (80%)** | 26 |
| **Static / white-box** (code review) | **12 of 15 (80%)** | 48 (36 beyond the 15 classes) |

```mermaid
pie showData title Vulnerability class coverage (both run types)
  "Covered" : 12
  "Missed" : 3
```

Same class coverage from both angles — but the source review goes **deeper**: reading all the code surfaces
roughly twice the confirmed findings (YAML-deserialization RCE, JWT algorithm confusion, unsalted-MD5
password storage, and more), each pinned to a file and line. Between them the black box covers SSRF that the
per-feature source pass mapped elsewhere, and the source review reaches code the live scan never hit.
Reproduce both with the harness in [`benchmark/`](./benchmark).

## Field-tested — a real CVE

Beyond the Juice Shop benchmark, ARCHON's **white-box review** found a real broken-access-control flaw in
a large production codebase — confidential issue data exposed through a missing authorization check. Jay
([@ghostshift-content](https://github.com/ghostshift-content)) reported it to **GitLab** via **HackerOne**;
it was fixed in GitLab's May 2026 security release and assigned
**[CVE-2026-4524](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-4524)** (CVSS 6.5, CWE-288).

- **CVE:** [CVE-2026-4524](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-4524)
- **GitLab advisory:** [patch release 18.11.3 · 2026-05-13](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2026/05/13/patch-release-gitlab-18-11-3-released/)
- **More in the pipeline:** Additional vulnerabilities surfaced by ARCHON have been responsibly disclosed and are awaiting vendor remediation — held under coordinated-disclosure embargo, so they're not named here until they're fixed.

That's exactly the class ARCHON's code-review squad specializes in — the same access-control depth ships as
MARSHAL's 40-pattern access-control catalog.

## Usage

1. **Authorize.** Confirm you have written permission for the target. Copy
   `common/config/scope_template.yaml` as your engagement scope and load it in the dispatch form's
   **Scope** field — scope is fail-closed, so a dispatch with no scope config is blocked.
2. **Dispatch.** Portal → *New dispatch*: target URL, optional source directory, credentials, test type,
   focus classes (optional), and severity profile.
3. **Watch.** *Tasks* shows live phase progress, which agents are working, and the test plan; validated
   findings land on the run's *Findings* board as they're confirmed.
4. **Review.** When the run **completes**, open its *Findings* tab — the validated set is already there;
   confirm/reject each, adjust CVSS and severity, add notes.
5. **Report.** Click *Generate report*; SCRIBE writes one report (combined runs are correlated and
   de-duplicated) and it lands under `var/intel/reports/`.

The full operator workflow — authorization checklist, field-by-field dispatch guide, and troubleshooting —
is in **[OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md](./OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md)**.

## Configuration

**Most users can skip this section** — a fresh clone runs with no env vars set; override only for a
non-default layout or a server deploy.

`paths.js` is the single root resolver. It auto-loads `.env.local` (gitignored) at require time so the
daemon, dashboard, and every spawned subprocess pick the roots up — but all three roots are **optional**:
they resolve to the repo dir (and `var/intel` under it) when unset, falling back to the `/root/agents`
server layout only when it actually exists. So a clone, a container, and a server all work unconfigured.

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `KURU_AGENTS_ROOT` / `ARCHON_ROOT` | Code root (where `event-bus.js`, `paths.js`, `squads/` live). Default: the repo dir. |
| `KURU_INTEL_ROOT`  | Data-layer root (runtime state). Default: `var/intel` under the code root. `npm run setup` seeds it. |
| `KURU_CLAUDE_BIN`  | Path to the `claude` CLI the agents spawn (default: resolve `claude` on `PATH`, e.g. `which claude`). |

**Authentication is your Claude subscription, not an API key.** Agents spawn the `claude` CLI, which
authenticates via OAuth (`~/.claude`); no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set or required, so runs count against your
subscription's limits, not metered API billing.

Optional, **off by default**:

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Dashboard port (default `4000`). |
| `KURU_PORTAL_SQUADS` | Comma-separated squads the portal exposes (default `pentest`). |
| `ARCHON_PORTAL_TOKEN` | Require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/api/*`. Set this before exposing the portal beyond localhost. |
| `ARCHON_SUBSCRIPTION_ONLY=1` | Hard-lock auth to your Claude **subscription** (OAuth). ARCHON never injects an API key for any agent — even if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is in the env or a saved config — so runs can never fall through to metered API billing. |
| `ARCHON_SCOPE_OVERRIDE=1` | Allow a dispatch with **no** scope config (Phase 0.0 is fail-*closed* — missing scope blocks the run). |
| `ARCHON_ACTIVE_POC=enabled` | Allow the gated Exploit-Prover to fire a **benign** impact-proving payload (e.g. RCE → `echo <nonce>`). Also requires `engagement_mode: active-poc` **and** a permission token in the dispatch. **Fires nothing by default.** Authorized engagements only. |
| `ARCHON_AUTONOMY=enabled` + `ARCHON_AUTONOMY_HOPS=<n>` | Surface the re-planning loop's follow-ups as an autonomy signal (hop-capped). The re-plan intel is always produced; this only flags auto-chase. |
| `ARCHON_ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_OS=1` (+ `ARCHON_ENABLE_<block>` / `ARCHON_DRIVE_<block>`) | Master switch for the experimental **Autonomous Agent OS** layer (Mission Director, knowledge graph, pattern catalogs, decision logging). Tri-state per block: enable ⇒ *shadow* (observe + write to `var/intel/shadow`, drives nothing); add `DRIVE` ⇒ *active*. **Off by default; flag-off is byte-identical to the deterministic pipeline.** See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). |
| `ADAPTER=cli` | Use the CLI runner adapter (rollback floor) instead of the default SDK adapter. |
| `ARCHON_PROXY_URL` | Route all outbound agent HTTP/HTTPS traffic through an intercepting proxy (Burp Suite, ZAP, mitmproxy). See **[Proxying traffic through Burp Suite](#proxying-traffic-through-burp-suite)** below. |

`var/` (all runtime state, findings, reports) is gitignored. See **[SETUP-LOCAL.md](./SETUP-LOCAL.md)** for
the portable-roots model in detail.

---

## Proxying traffic through Burp Suite

For pentest workflows where you want every request ARCHON's agents make visible in Burp (or ZAP,
mitmproxy, any HTTP(S)/SOCKS proxy) — for inspection, manual tampering, Collaborator, or just a
complete record of the engagement — set one env var:

```bash
# .env.local, or exported before `npm start`
ARCHON_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080   # Burp's default listener
```

That's it — proxying is **off by default** and this one var turns it on. It routes:

- Every subprocess a specialist agent's Bash tool spawns — `curl`, `nuclei`, `sqlmap`, `git`, `wget`,
  `python`, `node`, and anything else the agent invokes — via `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env forwarding
  (`agents/runner/adapters/common.js`).
- The `chain-verifier` step-replay engine's own `curl` calls (`src/pipeline/chain-verifier.js`).
- The headless Chromium the `browser-verifier` agent launches for DOM-XSS / postMessage / CSP-bypass
  verification, via Playwright's native `proxy` option.
- ARCHON's own `api.anthropic.com` calls (optional — only the low-frequency startup model-list check).

Loopback targets (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`) are **always** bypassed regardless of this setting, so
proxying a remote engagement never silently breaks requests to a local fixture or staging app you're
also running.

**TLS**: Burp's MITM cert isn't in your system trust store by default, so HTTPS requests through the
proxy will fail TLS verification unless you either:

1. **Trust Burp's CA (recommended)** — export it from Burp (`Proxy` → `Options` → `Import / export CA
   certificate` → Certificate in DER format, or PEM) and point `ARCHON_PROXY_CA_CERT` at the PEM file.
   This makes verification actually pass, rather than disabling it.
2. **Skip verification** — set `ARCHON_PROXY_INSECURE=1`. Convenient for a short-lived local session;
   avoid leaving it on for anything longer.

Full config surface (all optional beyond `ARCHON_PROXY_URL`):

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ARCHON_PROXY_URL` | Proxy URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. If unset, falls back to standard `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`. |
| `ARCHON_PROXY_ENABLED` | Explicit on/off. Default: enabled iff a proxy URL was resolved. `0` force-disables even with a URL set. |
| `ARCHON_PROXY_BYPASS` | Comma-separated extra `NO_PROXY` entries (e.g. `*.internal,10.0.0.0/8`), in addition to the always-bypassed loopback hosts. |
| `ARCHON_PROXY_CA_CERT` | Path to a PEM CA cert to trust (Burp's exported CA) — makes TLS verification pass through the MITM cleanly. |
| `ARCHON_PROXY_INSECURE` | `1` to skip TLS verification entirely instead of trusting a CA cert. Off by default. |

Implementation: `src/integrations/proxy-config.js` is the single source of truth all of the above reads
from — see the header comment there for the full design rationale.

## 🛡️ Safety & scope

The safety perimeter is **non-negotiable** and enforced in code:

- **Scope is fail-closed.** Phase 0.0 (`agents/scope-prevalidator.js`) blocks any dispatch with no scope
  config unless `ARCHON_SCOPE_OVERRIDE=1`.
- **Detecting ≠ exploiting.** Generating and firing payloads to *detect* vulns is the specialists' normal
  remit. *Demonstrating* impact (a real exploit that proves RCE) fires **only** behind a 3-gate opt-in:
  `engagement_mode: active-poc` + a permission token + `ARCHON_ACTIVE_POC=enabled`. By default ARCHON fires
  nothing impact-proving.
- **Non-destructive by default.** Built for pointing at live production: detection never deletes or modifies
  data, changes credentials/passwords, or runs a DoS; access-control (IDOR) is tested read-only; and
  repeated actions (rate-limit / brute-force) are capped at **10 attempts**. Enforced by a contract in every
  agent prompt (`GATE-14`), a destructive-pattern guard on ARCHON-executed requests, and a PreToolUse hook
  that hard-blocks destructive **local** commands (`rm -rf`, `curl | sh`) on your own machine — details and
  residual risk in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#non-destructive-by-default-production-safety).
- **Evidence contract.** A `CONFIRMED` finding needs replayable evidence (reproduction / proof /
  nonce-confirmed PoC) or it is demoted — no unverifiable claims in the report.
- **Nothing auto-published.** Findings validate live to your board; the report is generated on demand by the
  operator — never automatically.
- **Local-operator security.** The portal binds `127.0.0.1`; the data layer (which holds operator-entered
  test credentials) is written restrictively and `var/` is gitignored. Set `ARCHON_PORTAL_TOKEN` before
  exposing the portal beyond localhost.

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test         # unit suites (run-all.js gate). pretest auto-seeds the data layer.
npm run test:ui  # browser e2e (Playwright) — drives the portal + dispatch/triage/report flows
npm run test:bun # the few bun-only suites (node:test async semantics)
```

`npm test` is the product gate (green) and runs **fully offline** — no test touches the public internet
(HTTP-dependent suites start a local fixture server). A handful of deeper framework-internal suites are kept
in `test/` but skipped by the gate (they target a full multi-squad / PM2 deployment); run them individually
with `node test/<file>`. New `src/pipeline/*` modules ship with a matching `test/*.test.js`.

---

## Development & contributing

- Work from the repo root. Run `bash setup.sh` once (installs deps, seeds `var/intel`, runs the
  `npm run doctor` preflight). `.env.local` is optional — only for a non-default layout.
- **Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) first** — it documents the architecture, the pipeline phases, and the
  critical invariants (atomic writes, the evidence contract, never hardcode model strings, always resolve
  persona paths through `paths.js`).
- Keep changes test-backed: `npm test` must stay green (offline). Stage specific files (never `git add -A`);
  runtime drift under `var/` is gitignored — don't commit it.
- Contributions welcome via PR — see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the rules that block a PR.
  Extending ARCHON? Start from **[PLUGIN_SDK.md](./PLUGIN_SDK.md)**,
  **[AGENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](./AGENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)**, or
  **[PATTERN_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](./PATTERN_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)**. The principles every change is gated by are
  in **[ARCHON_MANIFESTO.md](./ARCHON_MANIFESTO.md)**.
- Release a clean artifact with `npm run pack:release` (see [RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)).

## Documentation

ARCHON keeps its planning and architecture in-repo so the project tracks like a real OSS effort:

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** | Architecture, file map, pipeline phases, and the invariants contributors must uphold. |
| **[docs/ARCHON-SYSTEM-MAP.md](./docs/ARCHON-SYSTEM-MAP.md)** | Top-to-bottom system map: every subsystem, end-to-end lifecycles, data layout, and the prioritized improvement surface. |
| **[docs/ORCHESTRATION.md](./docs/ORCHESTRATION.md)** | How a dispatch flows, which model each role uses, and the operational-health invariants. |
| **[OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md](./OPERATOR-RUNBOOK.md)** | Authorize → dispatch → review → report, field by field, with troubleshooting. |
| **[SETUP-LOCAL.md](./SETUP-LOCAL.md)** | Portable roots, `.env.local`, and the local-dev data layer. |
| **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** | Setup, the rules that block a PR, where things live, and the release flow. |
| **[ARCHON_MANIFESTO.md](./ARCHON_MANIFESTO.md)** | The principles every change is gated by — evidence, honest coverage, safe-by-default. |
| **[PLUGIN_SDK.md](./PLUGIN_SDK.md)** · **[AGENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](./AGENT_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)** · **[PATTERN_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](./PATTERN_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)** | Extend ARCHON: pipeline modules & squads, specialist personas, and vuln-class pattern catalogs. |
| **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** | Direction + the module-graduation plan. |
| **[RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](./RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)** | Clean-artifact packaging + the pre-release verification list. |
| **[BACKLOG.md](./BACKLOG.md)** | Open bugs and improvements: symptom → root cause (file) → fix. |
| **[docs/autonomous-agent-os-spec/](./docs/autonomous-agent-os-spec/)** | The Autonomous Agent OS blueprint — vision, architecture, schemas, prompts — plus the fit analysis ([FIT_AND_BUILD_PLAN](./docs/autonomous-agent-os-spec/FIT_AND_BUILD_PLAN.md)) and the wired, audited [ULTRAPLAN](./docs/autonomous-agent-os-spec/ULTRAPLAN.md) for evolving ARCHON into it behind feature flags. |

## Roadmap & status

**v1.0 — first stable release.** The core engagement pipeline (black-box, white-box, and the merged
mode), the safety perimeter, and the evidence contract are stable, and the test gate is green — ARCHON is
ready for authorized engagements. Post-1.0 work (further improvements and the flag-gated,
off-by-default Autonomous Agent OS layer) is tracked in **[BACKLOG.md](./BACKLOG.md)**,
**[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**, and **[§8 of the system map](./docs/ARCHON-SYSTEM-MAP.md)**. Open an issue
or PR to propose or pick up an item.
